# **DOVE3**

DOVE3 is an R package that implements the methods described in Lin et al. (2022) for estimating the time-varying effectiveness of vaccination and prior infection against COVID-19 related outcomes. It is an extension of the previous DOVE package by estimating the effects of multiple vaccine products as well as prior infection simultaneously under a single multiplicative intensity model. This package is under development and will be available soon.
